      <p id="first-p">My name is Chris Mikus, and I am a 25-year-old aspiring data 
        scientist enrolled in the Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp at George 
        Washington University.  I graduated from the University of Virginia in 2017 with 
        a degree in chemical engineering and a minor in materials science.  
        After graduation, I began working as a safety engineer and risk manager for the 
        US Navy, a position that I have now held for nearly three years. As the importance 
        of data collection and analysis increases, and as increasingly advanced 
        technological programs are released to process vast quantities of data, I would 
        like to develop some skills and learn some methods that can benefit my line of 
        work (especially since simulated results and data interpretation are preferable 
        to real-life incidents when investigating workplace safety and risk management).</p>
      <p>I initially became interested in data analysis through something admittedly 
        mundane: laboratory titrations.  To me, the most exciting part of the whole 
        procedure (trust me - titrations are <i>really</i> boring) was successfully 
        producing a model that could predict titration - so that I can use the model 
        for predicting chemical behavior instead of having to perform the 
        experiment again.  Developing skills to find, compile, and analyze large amounts
        of data would greatly improve the number of questions to which I could find answers,
        instead of hoping someone has done it earlier and shared their findings online for free.
        It would also admittedly be a pretty big flex if, during a discussion with a 
        friend over whether there was a relationship between heartburn relief supplement sales
        and Dorito flavor preference across the US, I would actually be able to get an answer.</p>
